The rapid ocean warming associated with current climate change is a major stressor to marine organisms which can be direct, e.g., on the organism physiology, or indirect, for example, by impacting the associated microbiome.
This latter aspect is so far much less studied.
We tested the impact of warming on the rocky intertidal, tropical invader mussel Brachidontes pharaonis, now dominating many shores in the south and eastern Mediterranean Sea.
However, B. pharaonis suffered mass mortality in the Summer of 2016, potentially due to a pathogenic response associated with heat stress. 
We hypothesized that elevated temperatures can disrupt physiological processes and alter the diversity of its microbiome.
